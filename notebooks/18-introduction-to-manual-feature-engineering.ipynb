    "# Introduction: Manual Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are new to this competition, I highly suggest checking out [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/start-here-a-gentle-introduction/) to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore making features by hand for the Home Credit Default Risk competition. In an earlier notebook, we used only the `application` data in order to build a model. The best model we made from this data achieved a score on the leaderboard around 0.74. In order to better this score, we will have to include more information from the other dataframes. Here, we will look at using information from the `bureau` and `bureau_balance` data. The definitions of these data files are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* bureau: information about client's previous loans with other financial institutions reported to Home Credit. Each previous loan has its own row.\n",
    "* bureau_balance: monthly information about the previous loans. Each month has its own row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual feature engineering can be a tedious process (which is why we use automated feature engineering with featuretools!) and often relies on domain expertise. Since I have limited domain knowledge of loans and what makes a person likely to default, I will instead concentrate of getting as much info as possible into the final training dataframe. The idea is that the model will then pick up on which features are important rather than us having to decide that. Basically, our approach is to make as many features as possible and then give them all to the model to use! Later, we can perform feature reduction using the feature importances from the model or other techniques such as PCA. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of manual feature engineering will involve plenty of Pandas code, a little patience, and a lot of great practice manipulation data. Even though automated feature engineering tools are starting to be made available, feature engineering will still have to be done using plenty of data wrangling for a little while longer. "

    "## Example: Counts of a client's previous loans\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the general process of manual feature engineering, we will first simply get the count of a client's previous loans at other financial institutions. This requires a number of Pandas operations we will make heavy use of throughout the notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `groupby`: group a dataframe by a column. In this case we will group by the unique client, the `SK_ID_CURR` column\n",
    "* `agg`: perform a calculation on the grouped data such as taking the mean of columns. We can either call the function directly (`grouped_df.mean()`) or use the `agg` function together with a list of transforms (`grouped_df.agg([mean, max, min, sum])`)\n",
    "* `merge`: match the aggregated statistics to the appropriate client. We need to merge the original training data with the calculated stats on the `SK_ID_CURR` column which will insert `NaN` in any cell for which the client does not have the corresponding statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "We also use the (`rename`) function quite a bit specifying the columns to be renamed as a dictionary. This is useful in order to keep track of the new variables we create.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might seem like a lot, which is why we'll eventually write a function to do this process for us. Let's take a look at implementing this by hand first. "

This measures the strength of a linear relationship between two variables and ranges from -1 (perfectly negatively linear) to +1 (perfectly positively linear). The r-value is not best measure of the \"usefulness\" of a new variable, but it can give a first approximation of whether a variable will be helpful to a machine learning model. The larger the r-value of a variable with respect to the target, the more a change in this variable is likely to affect the value of the target. Therefore, we look for the variables with the greatest absolute value r-value relative to the target.\n",

    "The kernel density estimate plot shows the distribution of a single variable (think of it as a smoothed histogram). To see the different in distributions dependent on the value of a categorical variable, we can color the distributions differently according to the category. For example, we can show the kernel density estimate of the `previous_loan_count` colored by whether the `TARGET` = 1 or 0. The resulting KDE will show any significant differences in the distribution of the variable between people who did not repay their loan (`TARGET == 1`) and the people who did (`TARGET == 0`).

    "After all that work, now we want to take a look at the variables we have created. We can look at the percentage of missing values, the correlations of variables with the target, and also the correlation of variables with the other variables. The correlations between variables can show if we have collinear varibles, that is, variables that are highly correlated with one another. Often, we want to remove one in a pair of collinear variables because having both variables would be redundant. We can also use the percentage of missing values to remove features with a substantial majority of values that are not present. __Feature selection__ will be an important focus going forward, because reducing the number of features can help the model learn during training and also generalize better to the testing data. The \"curse of dimensionality\" is the name given to the issues caused by having too many features (too high of a dimension). As the number of variables increases, the number of datapoints needed to learn the relationship between these variables and the target value increases exponentially. \n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection is the process of removing variables to help our model to learn and generalize better to the testing set. The objective is to remove useless/redundant variables while preserving those that are useful. There are a number of tools we can use for this process, but in this notebook we will stick to removing columns with a high percentage of missing values and variables that have a high correlation with one another. Later we can look at using the feature importances returned from models such as the `Gradient Boosting Machine` or `Random Forest` to perform feature selection."

The model is definitely not optimized to our data, but we still had a noticeable improvement over the original dataset when using the calculated features. Let's officially summarize the performances:\n",

    "All of our hard work translates to a small improvement of 0.014 ROC AUC over the original testing data. Removing the highly collinear variables slightly decreases performance so we will want to consider a different method for feature selection. Moreover, we can say that some of the features we built are among the most important as judged by the model. \n",

    "In a competition such as this, even an improvement of this size is enough to move us up 100s of spots on the leaderboard. By making numerous small improvements such as in this notebook, we can gradually achieve better and better performance. I encourage others to use the results here to make their own improvements, and I will continue to document the steps I take to help others. \n",

    "Going forward, we can now use the functions we developed in this notebook on the other datasets. There are still 4 other data files to use in our model! In the next notebook, we will incorporate the information from these other data files (which contain information on previous loans at Home Credit) into our training data. Then we can build the same model and run more experiments to determine the effect of our feature engineering. There is plenty more work to be done in this competition, and plenty more gains in performance to be had! I'll see you in the next notebook."
